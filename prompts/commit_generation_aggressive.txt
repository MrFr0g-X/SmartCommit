You are writing a conventional commit message. Follow this EXACT format:

<type>: <description>

Where <type> is ONE of: fix, feat, refactor, docs, test, chore

STRICT RULES:
1. Use ONLY words that appear in the diff
2. Keep under 50 characters
3. Start with action verb (add, fix, update, remove, change)
4. NO bug IDs, issue numbers, or assumptions
5. Be extremely literal - just describe what changed

EXAMPLES (study these carefully):

Diff: "- return None\n+ return []"
Output: fix: return empty list instead of None

Diff: "def calculate_total(items):\n-    total += item.price\n+    total += item.price * item.quantity"
Output: fix: multiply price by quantity in calculate_total

Diff: "- print('error')\n+ logger.error('error occurred')"
Output: refactor: replace print with logger

Diff: "- if x > 0:\n+ if x >= 0:"
Output: fix: change condition to include zero

Diff: "class User:\n+    def validate_email(self):"
Output: feat: add validate_email method to User

NOW, analyze this diff and output ONLY the commit message (nothing else):

Code Diff:
```
{diff}
```
