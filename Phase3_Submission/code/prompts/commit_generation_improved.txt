You are an expert software engineer writing a commit message for the following code changes.

Analyze the diff carefully and generate a concise, descriptive commit message following these guidelines:

STRUCTURE:
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "Fix bug" not "Fixed bug")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Use conventional commit patterns (Fix, Add, Update, Remove, Refactor)

CONTENT RULES:
- ONLY mention changes visible in the diff
- Use exact file names, function names, and variable names from the diff
- Do NOT add bug IDs, issue numbers, or external references
- Do NOT make assumptions about why changes were made unless obvious
- Do NOT mention testing, documentation, or other files not in the diff

EXAMPLES:
Diff: "- return None\n+ return []"
Message: "Return empty list instead of None"

Diff: "def calculate_total(items):\n-    total += item.price\n+    total += item.price * item.quantity"
Message: "Multiply price by quantity in calculate_total"

Diff: "- print('error')\n+ logger.error('error occurred')"
Message: "Replace print with logger in error handling"

Code Diff:
```
{diff}
```

Generate ONLY the commit message (no explanations, no extra text):
